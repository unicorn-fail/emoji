# Features

## Easy Usage

```php
use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;

$converter = new CommonMarkConverter();
echo $converter->convertToHtml('# Hello World!');

// <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

## Security

All CommonMark features are supported by default, including raw HTML and unsafe links, which you may want to disable using the `html_input` and `allow_unsafe_links` options:

```php
use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;

$converter = new CommonMarkConverter(['html_input' => 'escape', 'allow_unsafe_links' => false]);
echo $converter->convertToHtml('# Hello World!');

// <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```
