# Installation

The recommended installation method is via Composer.

In your project root just run:

~~~bash
composer require league/emoji:^1.0
~~~

Ensure that youâ€™ve set up your project to [autoload Composer-installed packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading).

## Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) will be followed closely.  **It's highly recommended that you use [Composer's caret operator](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret) to ensure compatibility**; for example: `^2.0`.  This is equivalent to `>=2.0 <3.0`.
